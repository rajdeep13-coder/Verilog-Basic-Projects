## ðŸ“Œ About  
This repository is a collection of **basic to intermediate Verilog projects**, designed to strengthen digital design fundamentals and prepare for **VLSI design** and **FPGA/ASIC flows**.  

Each module is written in **Verilog HDL** with a **testbench**, and can be simulated using tools like **Icarus Verilog**, **ModelSim**, or online IDEs like **EDA Playground**.
